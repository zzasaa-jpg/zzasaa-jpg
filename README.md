# Hi i'm @zzasaa-jpg (MahendraKumar)

My name is Mahendra Kumar from Yadgir, Karnataka, India. I am currently focused on **low-level systems development and computer architecture**, building a **virtual CPU and custom instruction set** from scratch in C++.  

I have experience in:
- **CPU design, memory management, and instruction decoding**  
- **Operating system concepts and low-level debugging**  
- Supporting C++ CLI tools for time tracking and file transfer  

Additionally, I have worked on **full-stack development projects** using the **MERN stack**, building both front-end and back-end applications.  

I am a **self-taught developer** passionate about systems programming, operating systems, and building software from the ground up.
